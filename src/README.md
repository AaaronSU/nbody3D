nbody: Original version of the N-body simulation algorithm.

nbody2: Transformation from Array of Structures (AOS) to Structure of Arrays (SOA) in the N-body simulation.

nbody3: Modification involving the addition of a delta to the original N-body algorithm.

nbody4: Modification involving the addition of a delta to the transformed version (nbody2) of the N-body algorithm.

nbody5: Comparison between the base (original) version and the improved version of the N-body algorithm.

nbody6: Representation of the N-body algorithm with only the improvements made, excluding the original version.
